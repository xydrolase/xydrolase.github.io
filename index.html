    <h3>Xin Yin</h3>
    <p>
    I am a PhD student in <a href="http://www.bcb.iastate.edu">Bioinformatics and Computational Biology</a> 
    (co-major PhD in <a href="http://www.stat.iastate.edu">Statistics</a>) at Iowa State University.
    My advisor is <a href="http://thirteen-01.stat.iastate.edu">Prof. Karin Dorman</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    I am interested in <em>computational genomics, data mining, statistical computing and high-performance computing</em>. 
    My current research focuses on developing probabilistic models to improve the data quality of prevalent next-generation sequencing platforms, through <em>error-correction</em> and/or <em>base-calling</em>.

    In my spare time, I guzzle coffee and <a href="https://github.com/xydrolase">program</a>. 
    I am also reviving my interests into electronics, to automate stuff (mostly for my cat).
